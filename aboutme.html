        <p>About me : My name is Shaurya Kaushik and i have been learning coding from from whitehatJr from 6 months 
            The games that you see on the home page are the concept of other games that i have created myself in this time instance.
         I am 12 years old and my favourite hobbie is coding,the reason why i love coding is because you can 
         create something that people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.</p>
